6) iostat -x
    !   man iostat
    ......
                  %util  Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were issued to the device 
                      (bandwidth utilization for the device). 
                      Device saturation occurs when this value is close to 100% for devices serving requests serially.  
                      But for devices serving requests in parallel, such as RAID arrays and modern SSDs, 
                      this number does not reflect their performance limits
    ......
    # The developer himself admits that the last column gives incorrect data for devices with multithreading support. 
    # The utility takes data from /proc/diskstats, but there is a -f flag that allows you to connect other sources of 
    # statistics if they are compatible. The rest of the flags do not affect the accuracy of the data.
