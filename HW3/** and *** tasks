# env -i #starts with an empty environment
# bash -l        Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see
#                 INVOCATION below).
# bash -c        If the -c option is present, then commands are read from  the
#                 first non-option argument command_string.  If there are argu‐
#                 ments after the command_string, the  first  argument  is  as‐
#                 signed  to $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the
#                 positional parameters.  The assignment to $0 sets the name of
#                 the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.
# bash -x        Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
